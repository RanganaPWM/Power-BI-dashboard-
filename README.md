I’d be happy to provide a step-by-step guide to creating a Power BI dashboard. Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft that allows users to visualize and analyze data from various sources. Here’s a clear step-by-step process to get you started:

you need the following tools for that :

01. Microsoft power BI
02. Adobe Photoshop/ Adobe Illustrator or Microsoft PowerPoint

Step 01: Import Data
Open Power BI Desktop and click on “Get Data” to import your data into the application. You can connect to various data sources such as Excel files, SQL databases, SharePoint lists, etc. Choose the appropriate data source and follow the prompts to connect to your data.


Step 3: Data Transformation and Cleaning
After importing your data, you may need to clean and transform it to suit your dashboard needs. Use the “Transform Data” option to perform actions like removing duplicates, renaming columns, filtering data, and creating calculated columns.

Step 5: Design Your Dashboard
Now comes the fun part — designing your dashboard! Drag and drop visualizations from the “Visualizations” pane on the right onto the canvas in the center. Some common visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, line charts, tables, and maps. Customize each visualization using the data fields you imported earlier.

first, you should have an image in your mind regarding what are points should be highlighted in the dashboard
01. Fraud Transaction percentage each year
02. Total Transaction amount in $ for each year
03. Total Fraud Transaction amount each year
04. Total number of Fraud Transactions each year
05. Total number of Transactions each year
06. Fraud Transaction count by Quarter and month
07. Fraud Transaction count by category
08. Fraud Transaction amount by category
09. Fraud Transaction count by state
10. Fraud Transactions according to Male and Female

Step 5: Decide the canvas size for the dashboard
Deciding the canvas size for a Power BI dashboard is an important step as it directly impacts how your visualizations will be displayed and how users will interact with the dashboard.

Purpose and Usage:
If the dashboard will be primarily viewed on widescreen monitors or TVs, a larger canvas size (e.g., 1920x1080) might be more suitable. The default canvas size in Power BI Desktop is 16:9 aspect ratio (i.e., 1280 pixels wide by 720 pixels high).On the other hand, if the dashboard will be accessed on smaller devices like tablets or smartphones, a smaller canvas size may be preferred to ensure a better user experience. However, you can customize the canvas size based on your specific needs.

Step 6: Add Interactivity Enhance your dashboard’s interactivity by adding slicers and filters. Slicers allow users to filter data quickly, making it easier to analyze specific aspects of the data. To add a slicer, select the visualization you want to filter, go to the “Visualizations” pane, and click on the “Slicer” icon. Here I used a “slicer” to mainly focused on the year to filter data.

Step 7: Add Calculations (Optional) If your data requires additional calculations or measures not available in the source, you can create them using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). DAX is a formula language in Power BI that allows you to create custom calculations for your data.

Here I used DAX calculations to calculate the following points.

01. Fraud Transaction percentage each year
02. Total Transaction amount in $ for each year
03. Total Fraud Transaction amount each year
04. Total number of Fraud Transactions each year
05. Total number of Transactions each year

Step 8: Apply Theme and Formatting Make your dashboard visually appealing by applying a theme and formatting. Go to the “View” menu and choose “Themes” to select a predefined theme or create a custom one. Additionally, use the “Format” option to adjust the appearance of visuals and the overall layout. If you want to do a custom theme your own one .can do as follows.

According to the structure of the dashboard, I created a layout background for that using Adobe Photoshop.


then finalized the dashboard as one page
